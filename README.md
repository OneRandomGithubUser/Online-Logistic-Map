# Compiling from source

To compile from source, first download and install Emscripten: https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html. Then run either _release_emcc_powershell.bat or _release_emcc_windows_terminal.bat (Windows only, other OS shell scripts may come), which will compile in PowerShell or in Windows Terminal (from the Microsoft Store). To view the webpage, install Python and run either _server_local_installation_python.bat if your Python is a local installation or _server_windows_store_python.bat if your Python is the Windows Store version, then go to localhost:8000 in your favorite web browser.

This program uses [FFTW 3.3.10](http://www.fftw.org/). If you wish to recompile FFTW (perhaps to update to a newer version), first download FFTW and extract it to a folder in the root directory of the project. In a Linux system (running Ubuntu in Windows Terminal after downloading and installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux will work for Windows), install Emscripten (if you are on Windows, it will need to be installed separately for the Linux subsystem), install make, and [precompile the library using Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/compiling/Building-Projects.html). Find the precompiled library in fftw-3.3.10/.libs (should be the largest file) and update the file paths in the compilation batch scripts if necessary. Optionally, rename fftw-3.3.10/.libs folders to fftw-3.3.10/libs to avoid Git errors from the period and add .libs to .gitignore to avoid Git errors from the empty .la files.
